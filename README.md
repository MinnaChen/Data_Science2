# Data_Science2
# About Project:
Implement different regression Technique such as: 
* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Quad Regression
* Reponse Surface

Implement forward selection and cross validation on these regression technique and observe differnce in R square 
adjusted R square and cross validated R square using graph.

# How to run:
Scalation:
* Go inside Regression folder using terminal
* Run sbt server inisde the Regression folder:     $ sbt
* To compile:     sbt:Regression > compile
* To run:         sbt:Regression > run
